            <p>Their music wasn’t just flexing and fast flows—it was real talk. They rapped about Delhi’s streets, politics, struggles, dreams, all while seamlessly switching between Hindi & English. And with Sez on the Beat backing them, their sound was getting crisper, harder, meaner.<br>By the time “Nayaab” (2022) dropped, they weren’t just “up next.” They were THE guys.</p>
            <p>Every track? Slapped. Every verse? relatable. Every beat? Hit different.<br>From grinding in cyphers to headlining festivals, from being just underground rap nerds to having a die-hard fanbase, they proved one thing—Indian rap ain’t just gully, it’s god-tier.</p>
